    <h1>Terms of Service - Swiftie Lover</h1>
    
    <p>Swiftie Lover by Nigelware</p>
    <p>By downloading the Swiftie Lover app and using our service (hereinafter "Services"), Licensee agrees to be bound by the following terms of service:</p>

    <p>This software license is entered into by and between Nigelware and the person licensing the Services (hereinafter "Licensee").</p>

    <p>The use of the Services by Licensee is subject to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Licensed Application End User License Agreement (EULA)</a>, which Licensee agrees to when using the Services. In addition, the following terms of service apply:</p>

    <h2>1. Subscription</h2>
    <p>If Licensee uses our Services on a paid subscription basis, the following terms apply:</p>

    <h3>1.1 Payment</h3>
    <p>The payment will be charged to Licensee's iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Auto Renewing</h3>
    <p>Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's account settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.</p>

    <h4>1.2.1 Payment</h4>
    <p>The Licensee will be charged no more than 24 hours before the start of the upcoming subscription period. If, for any reason, the payment cannot be processed (such as due to an expired card or insufficient funds) and the Licensee has not canceled the subscription, they will remain responsible for any outstanding charges. We will attempt to process the payment again once the Licensee updates their payment information. This may affect the start date of the next subscription period and the billing date for future periods.</p>

    <h3>1.3 Free Trial</h3>
    <p>Swiftie Lover offers a free trial. The Licensee can unsubscribe before the free trial ends without being charged.</p>

    <h2>2. Privacy</h2>
    <p>The use of the Services is subject to our Privacy Policy. For further information, see our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
